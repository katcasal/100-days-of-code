# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: Just started the 100 days of code challenge and started on the "Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5" challenges. Challenges cleared: "Say Hello to HTML Elements" up to "Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field".

**Thoughts** A good start on Day 1 of the challenge. Try completing more challenges for the next day.
